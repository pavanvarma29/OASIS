			<b>VIRAT KOHLI</b> 5 November 1988 
			the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed  
			batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic  
			cricket.Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds  
			the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the  
			International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has  
			also contributed to a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World  
			Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. 
 
			Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and  
			started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international  
			debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his  
			Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings  
			for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for  
			the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone,  
			becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer  
			to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in  
			2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single  
			decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian  
			national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped  
			down as the captain of the Test team as well.
